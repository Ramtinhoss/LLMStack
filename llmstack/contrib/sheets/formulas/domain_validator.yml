    data:

        task: >-
          Verify the validity of a given company domain and classify its status.
          Summary of Actions:
            - Access the domain and check its response.
            - Determine if the domain is active, returns a 404 error, is parked, or is a redirect.
            - Ensure the domain is not an email address and is a properly formatted website domain.
            - Ensure the domain is not a google.com/maps link. That does not represent a businesses website.
            - Classify the domain based on its status.
            
          Detailed Step-by-Step:
            1. Domain Access: Start by navigating to the domain URL provided.
            2. Response Check:
              - Observe the response when the domain is accessed.
              - If the page loads normally, proceed to step 3.
              - If the domain returns a \\\"404 Not Found\\\" error, classify it as a \\\"404 Error.\\\"
              - If the domain redirects to a generic hosting provider page (e.g., GoDaddy, Bluehost), or shows content indicating that it is "For Sale" or "Parked" classify it as a "Parked Domain"
              - If the domain redirects to a non-generic hosting provider and it is a valid business website, return the website.    
          Content Verification:
            - If the domain loads, verify that the content is genuine and not a placeholder or domain parking page.
            - Check for indicators of an active, operational website, such as legitimate company information, products, services, or blog content.
            - If the domain shows only a placeholder or minimal content (indicating it might be parked or inactive), classify it as \\\"Parked Domain.\\\"\\n\\nSecondary Checks:\\n- Use online tools or commands (e.g., ping, whois, or domain lookup services) to further verify the status of the domain if uncertain.
            - If the domain is listed for sale or shown on a hosting page without any real content, it is not a valid, active domain.
            
          Constraints:
            - Focus on determining whether the domain is actively being used.
            - Ignore any domains that are clearly placeholders or listed for sale without real content.
            - Consider a domain valid only if it displays a functioning website with meaningful content. Email addresses should return \\\"Invalid\\\". 
            - Domains that contain google.com/maps should return \\\"Invalid\\\":
            
          Output Format:
            - Return \\\"Valid Domain\\\" if the domain is active with real content.
            - Return \\\"404 Error\\\" if the domain returns a 404 error.
            - Return \\\"Parked Domain\\\" if the domain is a placeholder, for sale, or redirects to a generic page.
            - Return \\\"Invalid\\\" if the input is not a properly formatted domain (email addresses, google maps links, etc...)
            - If the domain redirects to a non-generic hosting provider and it is a valid business website, return the website it redirects to.\\n\\nDo not return anything outside one of these 5 options.
