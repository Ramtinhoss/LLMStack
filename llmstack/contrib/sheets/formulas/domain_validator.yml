        Verify the validity of a given domain and classify its status.\\n\\nHere's the domain to verify: \" + {{Input_1}} + \"\\n\\nSummary of Actions:\\n\\n- Access the domain and check its response.\\n- Determine if the domain is active, returns a 404 error, is parked, or is a redirect.\\n- Ensure the domain is not an email address and is a properly formatted website domain.\\n- Ensure the domain is not a google.com/maps link. That does not represent a businesses website. \\n- Classify the domain based on its status.\\n\\nDetailed Step-by-Step:\\n1. Domain Access: Start by navigating to the domain URL provided.\\n2. Response Check:\\n- Observe the response when the domain is accessed.\\n- If the page loads normally, proceed to step 3.\\n- If the domain returns a \\\"404 Not Found\\\" error, classify it as a \\\"404 Error.\\\"\\n- If the domain redirects to a generic hosting provider page (e.g., GoDaddy, Bluehost), or shows content indicating that it is \\\"For Sale\\\" or \\\"Parked,\\\" classify it as a \\\"Parked Domain.\\\"\\n- If the domain redirects to a non-generic hosting provider and it is a valid business website, return the website.\\n\\nContent Verification:\\n- If the domain loads, verify that the content is genuine and not a placeholder or domain parking page.\\n- Check for indicators of an active, operational website, such as legitimate company information, products, services, or blog content.\\n- If the domain shows only a placeholder or minimal content (indicating it might be parked or inactive), classify it as \\\"Parked Domain.\\\"\\n\\nSecondary Checks:\\n- Use online tools or commands (e.g., ping, whois, or domain lookup services) to further verify the status of the domain if uncertain.\\n- If the domain is listed for sale or shown on a hosting page without any real content, it is not a valid, active domain.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n- Focus on determining whether the domain is actively being used.\\n- Ignore any domains that are clearly placeholders or listed for sale without real content.\\n- Consider a domain valid only if it displays a functioning website with meaningful content.
